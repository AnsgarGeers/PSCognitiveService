# Microsoft Cognitive Services (aka, ProjectOxford)
Microsoft Cognitive Services (aka -  <b><i>Project Oxford</b></i> - https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services ) are some machine learning AI API's to give Human Side to your code and a beatiful user experience. These are RESTfull API's and are easily accessible once subscribed.

I managed to wrap these RESTful API's in a powershell module and results and things we can achieve with this are amazing! ðŸ™‚

# Pre-Requisites
You need to do one-time registration for each Microsoft Cognitive Services API from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up">HERE</a>, before start using the module, because it wonâ€™t work without an API Key.

I would suggest to Save the API Keys into your Powershell $Profile so that it automatically loads every time the console is fired.
Below is a screenshot on â€“ how to keep the API keys in your $Profile to make your life a bit easy
